#### But wait... there is more!

##### You can add hostings that aren't supported by Real Debrid 

##### (And by that i meant mirrors of supported hostings by Real debrid)

Example: Turbobit.net **is** supported but **not** its mirrors on Real Debrid.

('turbobif.com', 'turbobit.com', 'turb.to', 'turb.pw', 'turb.cc', 'turbo.to', 'turbo.pw', 'turbo.cc', 'turbobit.net', 'trbbt.net ')



*Search for* 

```python
def get_premium_link(url):
```

And add the mirror of hostings that aren't supported by Real Debird.



As you can see in the code:

```python
for mirror_host in ['turbobif.com', 'turbobit.com', 'turb.to', 'turb.pw', 'turb.cc', 'turbo.to', 'turbo.pw', 'turbo.cc', 'turbobit.net', 'trbbt.net']:
    url = url.replace(mirror_host, 'turbobit.net')
```

This allows to allow the mirrors of Turbobit to be accepted. You can add more

Just do in a new line after that:

```python
for mirror_host in ['MIRROR LINK', 'MIRROR LINK']:
    url = url.replace(mirror_host, 'ACCEPTED LINK BY RD')
```



### How to use?

1. Install python

2. Install requirements

3. ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. If you are using docker, edit Docker file, Default is "uploader.py" but you can change it if you want to use "main.py" Also in docker file enter the Real Debrid API and Token

5. Edit main.py and uploader.py with your Real Debrid API and Token

6. If using Docker run them using 

   ```
   sudo docker build . -t rd
   ```

   ```
   sudo docker run rd
   ```

   

7. run main.py or uploader.py

8. ```python
   python main.py
   ```

    or 

   ```python
   python uploader.py		
   ```



**HOWEVER....**

- There is no progress bar yet. So try to check logs if anything wrong happened. 
- And probably you need more requirements ><
